**Important Usage Considerations:**
- **5-Hour Session:** Claude Code usage is tracked in 5-hour sessions that reset from your first prompt.
- **Shared Usage:** Usage counts towards both Claude.ai chat and Claude Code; heavy terminal use impacts available messages.
- **Codebase Size:** The complexity and size of your project can affect your message limits.
